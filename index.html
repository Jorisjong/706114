		The kinetic energy recovery system is a system used in formula racing. 
		The system takes the energy used when a car brakes and later uses it to give the car an extra boost.
		Some formula teams choose not to use KERS because of the added weight.
		KERS also makes formula racing more eco friendly. 
		Because the energy used to brake isnt wasted but instead used in a later part of the race.
		The system also makes races more interesting to watch, 
		a driver can use the system in the last part of the race to catch up.
		There are upsides and downsides to the KERS, its up to the individual teams to use this system or not.</p>

		The video assistant referee is a referee that watches the match through special cameras. 
		The var helps with identifying goal validity, penalty kicks, red cards and offsides. 
		Because the referee on the field cant always see whats happening the VAR helps to make these important decisions. 
		The VAR does not step in when a player is given a yellow card, a corner is given or a faul has been committed.
		The field referee does not always have to take the advice of the VAR. </p>

		<p>
		Virtual Reality is an important technology in sport. VR is used in alot of sports, from formula 1 racing to rugby. 
		VR helps players practice where ever they are. 
		For example, VR is used by formula drivers to explore the track without actually having to drive on it.
		This is important because a driver only gets a limited time for exploring the track on track. 
		VR gives drivers more practice time for difficult corners.
		In rugby VR is used to practice line-outs, high balls and first phase attacks. all without needing an actual field.</p>
