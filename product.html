			<h1>Oxygen in a can</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
		Oxygen in a can was invented in 2007. The product is exactly what the name entails, 
		pure oxygen in a can for you to breathe. The oxygen is organically harvested from free range trees.
		These free range trees are not hurt in the process and live very long and happy lives.
		The can has a very user friendly design. Just put your mouth onto the mouthpiece and press the button to
		release the oxygen. A can of organically harvested oxygen lasts about a day of constant use. 
		However we recommend using oxygen in a can only after heavy exercising.

			<h1>The benefits</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
		Oxygen in a can is used worldwide by top athletes. After a hard long workout you are almost always out of breath. 
		Oxygen in a can solves this problem by supplying your body with pure oxygen, therefor your body does not need to filter out
		all the dirty air before getting actual usable oxygen. The pure oxygen out of this gets absorbed immidiately causing you to
		catch your breath way quicker. Once the need for more oxygen is met, you wont be out of breath anymore and can go back to exercizing.

			<h1>How to use</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
		Using the oxygen can is very simple. You can take it just like any other inhalation medication. Simply place the
		mouth place onto you mouth, press the button to release the oxygen and breathe in. Unpress the button, take the can
		off your mouth and breathe out. Do not breathe back into the can while the oxygen button is still pressed, this may
		contaminate the fresh oxygen inside. Oxygen is available in multiple flavors!
